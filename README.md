# Blackjack
This program is designed to allow for a user to play against a computer dealer in the game blackjack, also known as 21.  This game abides by the constraints of blackjack for for both the dealer and the player side.  The game tracks the win/loss record against the computer.

# Installation
The installation for this program merely involves downloading the code for the program and running it.  It should not require any setup involving external files.

# Usage
This game is played from the home screen that tells the reader the rules of blackjack.  Once the player has read the rules, they can continue to the gameboard by pressing the "start" button.  Once at the gameboard the user can begin playing blackjack. The player and the dealer start with 2 cards each, but the dealers first card is face down and therefore unknown to the user. Assuming the first 2 cards for either the dealer or the user do not equal 21, the user will be able to choose whether they wish to draw another card in an attempt to get closer to the dealer to 21. 

An ace can be valued at 1 or 11 and face cards, being jack, queen, and king, are valued at 10.  Number cards are valued at the number on their card.  A dealer must "stand" on a 17 or higher value, but has the option to draw additional cards if they have an Ace valued at 11 being the reason for the total being above 17.  A player automatically loses if they go above 21.  A player automatically wins if they do not go over 21, but the dealer does.  

Once a winner is determined, either the dealer or the user, the ability to draw cards and make the decision to not draw cards is disabled and the game can be reset with the win or loss being appropriately added to the users win or loss counters.
